# üêµ TrainChimp: The No-Code AI Fine-Tuning Tool

TrainChimp is an open-source local tool designed to streamline your entire generative AI lifecycle, from fine-tuning to scalable inference in a no-code way.

## üìå Overview of TrainChimp

TrainChimp provides a unified, user-friendly interface to:
- Launch no-code fine-tuning jobs for language models automatically using any available hardware accelerations (flash attention, fused kernels, etc) on remote GPUs.
- Handle private datasets as well as public huggingface datasets
- Efficiently utilize LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques for resource-efficient fine-tuning
- Manage analytics with Weights & Biases (wandb)
- Deploy and track deployed models:
  - LoRA serverless inference on Together.ai
  - Full model serverless inference on RunPod
  - Dedicated inference on Together.ai, RunPod, or Huggingface

## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ephibbs/trainchimp.git
cd trainchimp
./start.sh
```

## Fine-Tuning Options

Supported model types:
- Full Fine-tuning ‚úÖ
- LORA Fine-tuning ‚úÖ

Supported methods:
- SFT ‚úÖ
- DPO ‚úÖ
- PPO ‚úÖ
- GRPO ‚úÖ

Supported models:
- Llama 3.x Series ‚úÖ
- Qwen ‚úÖ
- DeepSeek ‚úÖ
- Others (?)

## Core Tech Stack
- Next.js for the frontend
- Huggingface for dataset and model hosting + metadata, dedicated inference
- Weights & Biases for analytics
- RunPod for fine-tuning that automatically starts and stops when idle, serverless inference
- Together.ai for serverless lora inference

## Fun Implementation Detail

Absolutely nothing is stored locally! I make use of huggingface's unlimited free public repo hosting to store all training artifacts and reuse their model card tagging system to keep track of metadata on all fine-tuning runs. This means you can delete the TrainChimp folder and start fresh or maintain multiple copies on separate machines without losing any of your fine-tuning history or active jobs!

## Future plans
- More model types (e.g. Diffusion, TTS, etc.)
- Add fine-tuning analytics & real-time monitoring with Weights & Biases
- Automatic evaluations on popular benchmarks (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.), create your own custom benchmarks
- Multi-GPU support
- More GPU providers (AWS, Lambda, Azure, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Only run this tool locally! Deploying this tool on a public server will expose your API keys. This project is a work in progress.
